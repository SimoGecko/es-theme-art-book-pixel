# Art Book Pixel

This is a modified Art Book Next theme for JelOS/Rocknix, forked from [es-theme-art-book-next-arkos](https://github.com/nkahoang/es-theme-art-book-next-arkos) using images from [es-theme-pixel](https://github.com/Jetup13/es-theme-pixel). Only the POWKIDDY RGB30 (screen aspect ratio 1:1) is supported currently.

You can follow the changes in `aspect-ratio-1-1.xml` if you would like to port this for other devices. Welcome any PR.
